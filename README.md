# Algorithms Labs – Searching, Sorting

This repository contains a pair of interactive **Jupyter notebooks** designed for college-level students to gain hands-on experience with fundamental **data structures and algorithms**.  
Students will explore algorithmic reasoning, complexity analysis, and classic problem-solving patterns through guided exercises and self-checking tests.

## Workflow 

1. **Clone** or **fork** this repository.
2. Create a new **branch** for your work, e.g.:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b algorithms-lab
   ```
3. Open the notebook in JupyterLab, VS Code, or Google Colab.
4. Complete all sections marked with:
   ```python
   # TODO: ...
   raise NotImplementedError("TODO: implement ...")
   ```
5. Run the **“Run tests”** cells to validate your solutions.
6. Once all tests pass, **commit** your work:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Completed algorithms lab"
   git push origin algorithms-lab
   ```
7. Open a Pull Request (PR) titled:
   > Algorithms Lab: Searching & Sorting  
   or  
   > Algorithms Lab II: Heaps & Graphs

## Requirements

Ensure Python ≥3.8 and Jupyter are installed.

To set up an environment:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

Optional (for Colab users): upload the `.ipynb` files directly.
